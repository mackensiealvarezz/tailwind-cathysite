                                nonfiction piece about a real car ride in May
                                2006, narrated by my current perspective of my
                                teenage self.</i></p>
                        <p>“Where in heck are we going?” Mom yells in her
                            Taiwanese accent. “Where to turn?”</p>
                        <p> I roll my eyes as my mother anxiously drives her
                            old, clunky minivan. I reply, “I told you like three
                            times Mom, we don’t have to turn until a couple
                            miles or so.” Then I lean back, breathe, and try to
                            relax.</p>
                        <p>From the back seat, my 10-year old sister Michelle
                            leans forward and says reassuringly, “Don’t worry,
                            Mommy…we’ll get there.”</p>
                        <p> My mom ignores the attempt to calm her down. She’s
                            clearly losing it and fuming at me. She yells, “You
                            told me this place near China Bowl restaurant! I
                            only comfortable drive to China Bowl! We pass it ten
                            minutes ago. I am <i>so</i> lost!”</p>
                        <p>For Mom, driving past a few familiar locations is as
                            difficult as it is for a third grader to take a
                            metaphysics exam. Currently, she’s driving 35 miles
                            an hour on a major Jersey highway. Furious that
                            she’s driving 25 miles below the speed limit,
                            several drivers honk and zoom past my mother,
                            merging in front of her. Mom couldn’t care less, as
                            she clutches the steering wheel tightly and stares
                            intently at the road.</p>
                        <p>I sigh as I tell my mother, “You’re not lost, Mom. I
                            have the MapQuest directions printed. You just need
                            to turn right onto Lawrence Street in like two
                            minutes. Then the breeder’s house should only be
                            like five minutes away, easy.” I think to myself,
                            <i>More like 15 minutes away.</i> It’s a white lie,
                            but my mom doesn’t need to know. </p>
                        <p>Trying not to get stressed, I focus on my excitement
                            to bring home an adorable little Shih-Tzu puppy. I
                            begged and begged my parents for one since I was six
                            years old. My parents promised that if I
                            consistently got straight A’s, they’d get me a puppy
                            when I was in junior high. And sure enough, I did
                            just that. Now that I’m in junior high, my mom and I
                            had been surfing the web. Eventually, I stumbled
                            upon a website named “Cheryl’s Shih-Tzu Puppies”
                            with a tiny eight-week-old black male pup. It was
                            obvious that he couldn’t sit still...he was trying
                            to get off the person’s hand that was holding him in
                            his photo. I knew I just <i>had</i> to convince my
                            mom to get him.</p>
                        <p>The next day, I told my mom anything I could to
                            persuade her. I pleaded, “He costs $800, only a
                            couple hundred above our budget...and the breeder’s
                            house is <i>super</i> easy to get to…really close to
                            the China Bowl restaurant!” Although I secretly knew
                            that the breeder is a good 20-minute drive away from
                            our favorite Chinese restaurant, I said what I
                            needed to say to get her to agree. She finally said
                            yes, knowing she was keeping her promise from years
                            before. </p>
                        <p>And now here we are…my mom, my sister, and I are
                            about to pick up the precious pup. We decided <i>not</i>
                            to tell my dad we were bringing home the dog. To my
                            father, getting a puppy is too expensive and too
                            much work. But my parents have had major marital
                            problems for years…so the imminent fight my mom
                            would have with my father for bringing home a dog
                            would be just another normal day.</p>
                        <p>Milton Avenue…Grand Avenue…according to my MapQuest
                            printout, it looks like we should have turned by
                            now. My father does not believe in any new
                            technology, so we don’t own a GPS. Trying to sound
                            as calm as possible, I take in a deep breath, turn
                            to my mother and say quietly, “Mom…I think we passed
                            the road we were supposed to turn on to.”</p>
                        <p>“WHAT?!” she shrieks in alarm.</p>
                        <p>“Don’t panic,” I tell her, raising my voice a bit.
                            “Just make a U-Turn somewhere. We’ll find it.”</p>
                        <p>She screams, “WHERE IS U-TURN??”</p>
                        <p>I shake my head and think about how easy this trip
                            would have been for my friends’ <i>normal</i>
                            parents. I reply, “I don’t know. If you had a GPS,
                            we would know…but we just need to follow the road
                            signs now.” </p>
                        <p>My mom yells, “FIND U-TURN FOR ME, OR WE IN BIG
                            TROUBLE!” </p>
                        <p>There’s no U-turn is in sight. I ask my mom to pull
                            into a gas station so I can ask for directions.
                            Secretly, I also want to get a break from my mother,
                            who’s angrily ranting. My mom drives into the
                            parking lot, slightly bumping into the curb as she
                            parks. </p>
                        <p>I ask a man at the gas station, “Excuse me, do you
                            know how I’d drive to Lawrence Street in Rahway from
                            here?” </p>
                        <p>The man replies in a thick Jersey accent, “Rahway is
                            south of here…you probably passed it while going up
                            Route 1.”</p>
                        <p>Trying to sound composed, I ask, “Where’s the closest
                            U-turn?” </p>
                        <p>He responds, “Should be a few miles north, just
                            follow the signs.”</p>
                        <p>Feeling hopeless, I call Cheryl the dog breeder with
                            my flip phone and it goes to her answering machine,
                            so I leave a message telling her we got lost but
                            should be there shortly. I think to myself, <i>We’re
                                probably not going to end up getting this puppy
                                after all.</i></p>
                        <p>Getting back into the car, I explain to Mom that we
                            should make a U-turn a few miles north. My mother is
                            staring out the car’s front window, surprisingly
                            calm. She then decides, “Let’s just go home.” </p>
                        <p>Michelle and I start to protest, but when my mother
                            shoots us a look that tells us it’s best to be
                            quiet, we immediately become silent. As my Mom
                            starts driving, I lean my head against the car
                            window, thinking, <i>The dog wouldn’t have liked
                                living with our weird, dysfunctional family
                                anyway. Probably better off this way.</i></p>
                        <p>Suddenly my cell phone rings. It’s Cheryl, who says,
                            “Cathy? Is that you? I just got your message on my
                            answering machine.” I hear a couple dogs barking in
                            the background.</p>
                        <p>I answer, “Yeah, hi Cheryl. So sorry, we got totally
                            lost. I’ll give you a call at a later time…”</p>
                        <p>Cheryl cuts me off, “Oh no worries at <i>all,</i>
                            honey! The cute little one is just <i>so</i> excited
                            to meet you! Tell me, where are you now? Maybe I can
                            help you find my house?”</p>
                        <p>I whisper to Mom that it’s Cheryl on the line who can
                            help us with directions. Mom groans reluctantly, but
                            to my delight she replies, “Tell her we near Shop
                            Rite…and Wendy’s…”</p>
                        <p>Thrilled that Mom’s on board again, I tell Cheryl,
                            “My mom’s driving, and we’re heading South on Route
                            1 and just passed the Shop Rite near Scott Avenue…”</p>
                        <p>Cheryl replies, “Just tell your mother to make a
                            right when you get to Hancock Street…you should see
                            it in two minutes.”</p>
                        <p>Soon Cheryl directs us off the highway, and we drive
                            into a suburban neighborhood with a nice canopy of
                            dark green tree leaves. When we finally find her
                            house, I get out of our minivan and greet her as she
                            walks outside. I tell her, “This is my mom Nancy and
                            my sister Michelle. So sorry we’re over an hour
                            late…it’s been quite an adventure to get here.”</p>
                        <p>Cheryl responds, “No worries…aren’t you from East
                            Brunswick, though? Isn’t that just a quick drive
                            away?”</p>
                        <p>My mom answers, “Yes, but I don’t like drive to new
                            place. Your house so hard to find…”</p>
                        <p>At that moment, I immediately tune out my mother when
                            I see a small black fur ball in Cheryl’s hand. It’s
                            the puppy! I could barely see his eyes, nose, and
                            mouth since they’re too dark to distinguish on his
                            black, flat face. Like a mini alligator, the puppy
                            yawns, and the size of his pink inner mouth seems to
                            be larger than his whole body. I exclaim, “Mom and
                            Michelle…look! Isn’t he so tiny and cute?” </p>
                        <p>Cheryl remarks, “Yes, he’s a little one…just two and
                            a half pounds. Want to hold him?”</p>
                        <p>She puts him into my palms. The puppy turns his head
                            and looks at our group curiously, his circular eyes
                            wide. He starts kicking his tiny feet, trying to
                            leave my grasp. </p>
                        <p>I place his little body into my mother’s hands. As
                            she looks into his eyes, my mom’s face breaks into a
                            small smile. The puppy starts to calm down, enjoying
                            being in my mother’s arms. </p>
                        <p>Mom asks Cheryl, “Is he trained? Will he poo and pee
                            in house?”</p>
                        <p>Cheryl replies, “No, he’s <i>really</i> well-behaved,
                            ma’am. He usually goes on those wee-wee pads which
                            you can find in any pet store. Soon he’ll be able to
                            go on walks!”</p>
                        <p>Mom responds, “Good. So, what we have to do to bring
                            him home?” My sister and I look at each other and
                            squeal with excitement. </p>
                        <p>Cheryl ushers us into her house, and she places the
                            tiny dog on the floor as she discusses the paperwork
                            and check to fill out. The puppy walks around the
                            room, sniffing the walls and corners, and then he
                            poops a bit on the carpet. Michelle starts giggling.</p>
                        <p>“Oh no!” Cheryl exclaims, as she promptly grabs a
                            napkin to scoop up the poop. She assures us, “This
                            rarely happens. Trust me.” My mom and I look at each
                            other skeptically, with slight smirks on our faces.
                        </p>
                        <p> ---</p>
                        <p> The puppy rests serenely as my sister and I pet him
                            on the back seat during the car ride home. My mother
                            directs us, “Tell your father we only got dog for
                            $500 if he ask. And remind him we will walk, feed,
                            and wash dog...he don’t have to worry about doing
                            anything.”</p>
                        <p> We all know that Dad will be furious. Usually I’d be
                            nervous, but I’m too content to think about it, as I
                            stroke our new puppy’s ebony fur. The little dog’s
                            body starts steadily going up and down as he
                            breathes quietly, and it looks like he’s fallen
                            asleep.</p>
                        <p>“What should we name him?” Michelle asks
                            enthusiastically. “Maybe Fluffy…he has such soft
                            fur!” </p>
                        <p> “Eck…I <i>hate</i> the name Fluffy,” I retort.
                            “Although I do love his soft dark fur. Maybe we’ll
                            name him something having to do with his black
                            hair.” </p>
                        <p> Mom says, “We should name him something start with
                            letter P. P for peace. Maybe he would bring our
                            house some peace…since we never get along.” </p>
                        <p> We all become silent, as we contemplate how life
                            would now be like with a new puppy. Would he help
                            bring some warmth and harmony into our divided
                            family? </p>
                        <p> “Pepper,” I say suddenly. “We should name him
                            Pepper.” Pepper, like black pepper…and like salt and
                            pepper. P for peace. </p>
                        <p> “Yes,” my mom and sister agree. Pepper is his name.
                        </p>
